Changes to standard documentation generated by doxygen:

- doxygen.css -> tbt.css
  - changed font size from 12px to 10pt
  - [changed font size in pre.fragment from 9pt to 10pt] (no longer required for doxygen 1.7.5)
  - moved css to root directory (due to bug in doxygen 1.7.5?); otherwise css is copied to
    html directory, but path to css in html pages is "doc/tbt.css" which cannot be found!

- footer.html
  - slightly adjusted (Copyright notice)
